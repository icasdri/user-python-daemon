# This module is meant to be used with the Thunderbird email client, a freedesktop notifications compliant desktop,
# and the Thunderbird Gnome Integration plugin. It's goal is to provide a single bus name for notifications fired
# from this plugin, allowing desktops with a "notification drawer" to display the notifications as originating from
# a single application.
